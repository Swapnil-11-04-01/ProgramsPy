# Write a Python program to move all zero digits to end of a given list of
# numbers.
# Expected output:
# Original list:
# [3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 6, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 7, 4, 4, 5, 3, 0, 0, 2, 9, 7, 1]
# Move all zero digits to end of the said list of numbers:
# [3, 4, 6, 2, 6, 7, 6, 9, 10, 7, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 9, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

l1 = [3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 6, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 7, 4, 4, 5, 3, 0, 0, 2, 9, 7, 1]

print(f"Original list : \n{l1}\n")

for i in l1:
    if i == 0:
        l1.remove(i)
        l1.append(i)

print(f"Final list : \n{l1}")
